## The Terrarium
Our group, [Giraffe Emoji] made a terrarium for our final project with a slight twist- including its own weather and animals that you might not expect to find in a traditional terrarium. 

## Major Features
- A Weather simulation (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy)
- A time of day slider
- Plants made from an L-System
- Fireflies acting as boids


## Smaller and Bonus Features
- wavy grass, moved by wind speed
- a moveable desk lamp
- a clock counting the time
- a (transparent) cow rigged and animated in blender
- lots of 3D low poly animals and plants
- transparency and refraction


## Libraries Used
@React-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for our main features- loading models and frame by frame animation. We also used Leva for our sidebar controls.

## Running Locally
cd into the main directory then type npm run dev
